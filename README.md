# Smart-Home-Project
I recently completed a smart home project using two ATmega32 microcontrollers to control the environment in four rooms. The system integrates with a TV and air conditioner for seamless control. To enhance security and access control, the system prompts users for both admin and guest passwords during the initial setup. Additionally, users are required to identify themselves as either guests or admins before gaining control.

A robust security feature has been implemented, where users are given three attempts to enter the correct password. After three unsuccessful attempts, access is temporarily blocked, adding an extra layer of protection. This ensures a secure and user-friendly smart home experience.
